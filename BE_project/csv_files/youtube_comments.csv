"Fled from a stalking ex, saved myself from an abusive boss who harassed me, cut off toxic people from my life, got diagnosed with ADHD, learned about my strengths and what makes me special, took 6 month sabbatical to get my life back together, applied for a great job and now I'm watching this video."
"Here's a summary of this video, I hope it helps!

The Butterfly Effect - It's an idea that a flap of the wings of a distant butterfly can somehow change the formation and course of a tornado thousands of miles away

This analogy refers to the idea that a small change can have rippling effects across an entire system

Why does it work?

- everything you want to do or not want to do depends on your self control
- research shows that people with better impulse control and self regulation (self control) are more likely to be successful in life

How does it work?

- Researchers came up with a hypothesis: self control is like a muscle, you can strengthen and improve it with repeated practice
- Researchers have an hypothesis that if you pick up an habit and practise it over and over again, it will be like training your self control muscle and thus, strengthening it over time
- WIth better self control, it will radiate throughout your entire life and make you much more disciplined in everything you do
- In conclusion, you can train yourself to have self control

What behaviour triggers this butterfly effect?

- It is called a keystone habit, this name comes from the word keystone which refers to an arc and the centre stone within the arc is called key stone because it holds everything together. If you remove it, everything comes crashing down
- A keystone habit refers to a habit in which all the other things are built upon
- A keystone habit can be any habit but it is very individualised, e.g. making your bed, studying, waking up at 5 am, journalling etc.
- To find your keystone habit, you need to understand yourself and find out what habits benefit you the most by trying out different things and experimenting with them
- Ask yourself, ‘what are the things that make you feel good afterwards?’ or ‘what are the things that match my traits?’ e.g. starting the morning right
- Once you establish the keystone habit, all the other routines naturally fall into place
- To find a good habit, be introspective, find out what time of the day it matters to you the most and make sure it is relatively short which you can do on a daily basis
- Habits come in a loop: first there’s a cue, then you have a routine to satisfy that cue and then you end up having a reward which is followed by a craving. This in turn triggers the cue and the cycle continues
- The cue could be a certain time of the day, the routine is the act of completing a task, the reward could be the satisfaction of completing the said task and the craving is the need to satisfy the cue again
- SECRET INGREDIENT: if you are able to include other people into your habit, you’re much more likely to stick to that habit. Why? because people are important to us since we are inherently social creatures. We are influenced by people so much that we can become a lot like the people we choose to be around. The people we choose can either make or break you.
- Some examples of incorporating other people in your habits are: having gym buddies, studying in groups, taking courses with your friends"
"I think my key stone habit is going to the gym (weight lifting + calisthenics) because it forces me to eat healthier & more protein, drink more water & generally structure my days in a way so I have energy and time to go to the gym. The gym is the place where I push myself mentally & aim each time to increase my weights. It builds resilience   Which also trickles down to the other areas of my life, especially uni & my other projects. It’s not a “simple” habit really but still keeps me going."
"2 key takeaways :
1. Set a keystone habit
2. Include people in your habit"
"I once heard the saying ""How you do one thing is how you do everything"", and it's change my outlook, because on one hand everything I do down to washing the dishes becomes worthy of paying attention to and doing to the best of my ability, but on the other hand, I can make massive improvements towards my goals just by adjusting small behaviors. This video helped me revise my daily routine of tasks and I think it'll really help because I think I'd been missing on having rewards built-in, which led me to overwork myself with no feedback, and then over-indulge. Here's to being the master of my own time, labor, and destiny in the new year!"
"I love the idea of a keystone habit! Morning yoga is definitely mine. I started doing yoga sporadically at the beginning of the pandemic, then just kept coming back to it again and again because I felt better when I did. It got to the point that it was so noticeable, when I had a bad day my partner would ask, ""you didn't do your yoga today, did you?"" Now, my craving is so strong I do yoga every day, even if I'm sick or sad and can only do a few minutes, and I'm now at 315 days straight of yoga every day! It really does set up my day right and make me feel healthy and accomplished and motivated for more."
"I am officially at a MUCH, MUCH lower of “fucked-upness!” I hit a year sober last week but  haven’t really given myself the amount of props and credit I deserve."
"I actually stumbled upon my “keystone” habit by just focusing on a habit I could (1) perform daily (2) would be a positive improvement in my life and (3) is relatively easy (from my POV) to implement. I was in a pretty dark place and decided to implement a morning routine since I did not have one anymore. I found that just focusing on my morning routine (and being kind to myself when I wasn’t able to do it) has been really beneficial. I’ve even gotten to the point where I now do it every day and am currently focused on building other habits now, which I added in one at a time."
"my keystone habit: 5:30 AM CrossFit classes. I wanted to get fitter and stronger and joined CrossFit about a year ago. I was struggling to get to classes after work and would often be ""too tired"" or have a meeting or a social invite, so I'd skip. Fast forward to October 2022, and I decided to give the 5:30 AM class a try. Once I started this, I realized the class vibe was so positive, filled with others dedicated to getting a pre-work workout.  My energy levels changed significantly and I started making other positive changes. I cut back on the drinking (and eventually stopped, 80 days sober now), making my bed, meditating, and journaling all before work and after my workout. I am eating cleaner, going to bed earlier, and sleeping so much better. In the past few weeks, I even began creating art again regularly. The one regular habit I have dedicated to has influenced so many other things in my life. "
"I play the same 3 affirmation videos every morning and afternoon on my commute. I didn’t know it was a keystone habit til this very moment. It’s part of my routine and helps me have patience and a better attitude. If I decide to listen to a podcast or music instead, it’s ok but slowly, everything starts falling apart. I’m more tired and easily irritated and have worst days. So every time I get in my car that’s my cue. Reward is my mood shifting. And then I wanna have a good day so it repeats!"
"""Level of fuckedupness""  i love the words you use to express points. it just hits the nail on the head."
"This is brilliant and I think an immediate reward is so necessary for the craving part. My friend goes on runs every day. And usually it takes like 2 weeks to get to the point where just running is fun. Before then, it sucks, it makes you more tired and sore, so you’re less likely to stick with it. To combat this, she started to listen to her favorite podcast only while she ran. So that became the reward and the craving. Now she gets really excited to run because she can listen to her podcast."
"You are one of the young people I am learning so much from, at age 70! Thank you, Tina!"
"I'm so happy to be seeing videos from you again! In a couple of them, you mentioned this part of your life has been chaotic and painful, but here's a bright side: when you figure out how to get past this (you will!), you can make videos about it and help so many other people going through painful and chaotic times."
"Damnnnn!! This is so so amazing because I've actually been thinking about this concept on my own when i figured that everything falls into place for me when i get up early so i probably just need to focus on that. Now watching that concept as a keystone habit in your video with so much evidence and all, it made me so happy and believe this thing even more. Thank you! I'll just stick to making this waking up early morning habit!"
"Love your videos! As a psychologist specialized in behavior change I would like to add that strengthening self control is likely only one (probably the smaller) of two relevant parts to sustainable behaviour change : I like to refer to this 2011  paper which highlights the importance of setting up all the ways to minimize impulse behaviours requiring less self control!

Hope it helps "
Crazy as it sounds for me it’s weighing myself first thing in the morning. I recently fell in a slump w my exercise but as soon as I started tracking again I became motivated to work out again and that in turn gets me to make all sorts of healthy choices.
"Happy new year Tina!! 
I hope you get to your keystone habit schedule soon . Haven't found mine but will work on it now that the video helped me!"
"My keystone habit is making healthy drinks for my husband and myself in the morning. I start by making 32 oz of water with lemon for each of us then I sip it while I make cucumber or celery juice to drink next and finally I make a large portion of green juice from kale, lemons, apples, ginger and celery to drink throughout the day. I don't like washing my juicer so I get all the juice made at once and dole it out as needed. We stay well hydrated, get our leafy greens in and feel more energy."
your videos are goldmines! your pacing is also perfect. thank you for what you do! 
"I started writing this huge comment, but instead just want to say Thank You, Tina. I found you at the perfect time in my life. You have a new subscriber and intent follower. Keep doing what you’re doing and know that you are affecting lives for good. "
I love this video because I have actually developed a keystone habit without knowing that's what I was doing and this just like affirmed that I'm on the right track. I love this for me! Thank you for this video!
"This honestly is not a new concept, but your storytelling is good so I don’t get bored and stay until the video finished. Thanks!"
"I've decided to do this. my keystone habit is drinking water. Let's face it, I've been chronically dehydrated my entire life. This comment is to mark my journey and hold me accountable to updates. It's been about 3 days and so far I've noticed more bowel movements and a slight desire to drink water (none before) maybe this is tied to the reward of feeling accomplished. Let's go
04/03/23: my health is improving, skin, my eyes look more alert, no more dry eyes or lips, lips actually got bigger, better sleep and dream recall. I feel more energetic. Eating more consistently at mealtimes. Feeling more confident.
04/30/23: One month in. What a difference. My life is flowing! Drinking warm water in the morning with lemon, cucumber, or lime really helps me drink when I wake up and don't want cold water hitting my system. My skin keeps getting better and better. I can feel the internal hydration. Long term tension in my body is dissolving and relaxing. Sleep is feeling more and more rejuvenating. This sense of accomplishment and empowerment is building..
11/27/23: Wow, I forgot about this comment. I got into the habit of tracking my goals elsewhere. So, 8 months in! And this video pops up in my recommended at the perfect time. I have successfully incorporated drinking water into my lifestyle! It's been difficult. My entire life, I don't really have a thirst cue unless i work out extremely hard. Apparently my Kenyan grandmother is the same way. So I'm really proud of all the hard work I've put in to reach this level of consistency. 
I alone know how much of a struggle it's been. 
Note to self: Celebrate dear! 
You're amazing. I'm so proud of you. Keep it up. You got this!
That being said, Winter is here. And with the colder temperatures here now, I noticed I'm starting to drink less water so this is the perfect opportunity to level up. Time to adapt and overcome. I'm going to start warming up a kettle of water in the mornings for the day. Maybe I'll keep a thermos. Ok, so for the million dollar question, has my life completely changed from this habit? Hmm.. I haven't reflected on this until right this moment.. My God, it really has. Strange. I didn't think of it coming from drinking water, that kinda faded to the background. 
But I am vastly different from my former self just 8 months back.  Was it really the water?
I'm not depressed anymore or anxious. I'm energetically making my goals happen. I no longer see myself as chronically fatigued. My sleep is better. I've done a lot of work on myself this year. The biggest change came with integrating my shadow self and accepting my worthiness. 
I did it. I'm realizing I really did it. I set forth a goal to create a keystone habit of drinking water and leverage it into changing my life. And I did it. Epic. So glad this video popped back up. Hope this inspires someone to take their journey. Feel free to ask me any questions. Merry Christmas."
"Super interesting video! I am experiencing this personally in my life at the moment. I've had a vice the past few years that I cut out because it was disruptive. I noticed that by cleaning up this one thing, I'm finding other habits much easier to address as well. It's definitely feels accurate for me to call it a 'ripple effect'. 

Thanks for making this!"
I love the way you talk. I found myself completely immersed. Thank you
"Now I know why my day goes as a  complete mess and unstructured if I don't exercise. Because it can be my keystone habbit. I stated it 1 year back. I was never consistent. It was always an on - off kind of habbit, but every day I would exercise my rest of the things would automatically fall back on its place. I need to utilize this realization. Thank you so much."
Awesome channel with really varied and very informative subject matter! Thanks!
Thank you @Tina Huang ... I got to set my keystone stronger ... Happy 2023...
"yeah it's wild what getting small discipline wins in one area can do for other areas.  I started out at the start of the year just doing intermittent fasting 12-8 and trying to study more, then later added a morning routine I do every day at 6.  Those 3 changes have made me feel like a completely different person in just 3 weeks, can't wait to see where they'll lead me in months or years.  Society romanticizes monumental leaps of improvement and drastic changes, but turns out just changing a few small things is the best place to start."
"Found out I had a severe genetic disorder and even though I was very happy - good student, already a successful career, many dreams that I am great at initiating and in others also- the doctor gave me pamphlets for support groups. I went. It had consumed my life and even my health. I now see exactly why, started with FIVE PEOPLE. Thank you so much. I now know my pathway out! I subscribed, excited to see what else you have up your sleeve… "
"This happened to me when I started being more consistent in the gym, my nutrition started changing, my work habits slowly started changing, and other factors started changing by proxy. It's pretty cool!"
"This is so inspiring thanks for sharing your story. I started my path to reinventing myself a year ago, I'm now living healthier, confident, stronger, making 6 figures, having leisure to enjoy family &friends. I feel happier and living my life for myself. This is to encourage someone ""you can start anytime to have a reset it's worth it! I'm striving to continue growing cus it's a journey"
"I definitely want to improve my habits and would like to get to a place where my mornings actually feel good and I can maintain energy and momentum. I still need to find my key habits. My days tend to revolve around my kiddo and chores since I am a SAHM but trying to get into doing something for myself. I've been teaching myself web dev, about to start a boot camp, and want to eventually enroll into a software engineering degree program. Life can feel chaotic and exhausting, with not enough time or energy in the day. And I also feel that lonely aspect too."
"Absolutely loved this video! The butterfly effect analogy is such a powerful way to illustrate how small, consistent changes can lead to significant transformations in our lives. The actionable tips and insights shared here make it feel attainable and motivating."
"The value of having self-control & teaching it to your children from a very young age is so under rated. My kiddos fought me as I was teaching them, they thank me, now. I made the times that I taught them, a lot of fun so that they would like it. This can stick with a child or sometimes it doesn't or in varying degrees.
I had my kiddos with me when I did banking or did grocery shopping or cleaned the car, etc
They took turns with a pocket calculator, in the grocery store, adding up for the total. They knew the budget. They also knew that if there was money left over in the budget, it would go into our vacation fund, so we could do fun things.
Another way was that every time there was a carnival near where we lived, if we didn't spend money at the carnival we would have enough to have a really good time at Disney World.
I was especially proud of my youngest. She worked very hard to get her engineering degree. Degrees in engineering are very expensive.
She graduated at the top of her graduating class ~ no student loan debt."
As always great video Tina and happy new year! Love how you integrate findings from research papers in the video essay :)
"Very informative. New subscriber here. I 100% agree with involving friends and family to help you improve or change your habits. The social aspect is so important, in so many ways. Peer pressure, in a positive way, group gratification is another. Good video Tina."
Thank you so much for sharing the impact of falling off of your keystone habit. This made me realize why I’m in such a funk lately!
"Thank you for this video!!! 
Happy New Year! "
It's wonderful you get into an environment like this
"Very helpful.
Makes perfect sense..
In one ear and out the other.
Imma watch another 50 videos how do I improve my life.
Then then do the same thing the next 10 years."
"I think my keystone habit is journalling, I feel bad when I can't check the box when I missed any habits that I set for myself. I finally found that it's the one who keeps me going."
this is exactly what i needed to hear.. thank you young lady
"Amazing! Thank you, Tina! "
"thank you , it is inspiring and in fact, i noticed when i do some self discipline about One habit, i feel empowered and then it ripples in fact :) thank you for sharing your advices ! it is helping to self aware of it, thank you <3 love from France :)"
Another awesome video! I need to focus on my keystone habits this year. I'm trying to make them quite prominent in my journal I've just set up for the year!
I really like your videos. You're smart and very enjoyable to watch. Thanks for doing the work to create these.
"I believe my keystone habit is my two 50-minute HIIT classes per week. It forces me to get everything else done from day to day - drinking 2000mL of water, taking my vitamins, eating three meals a day. Everything has fallen into place quite nicely."
"Your video was recommended to me today. 
NEW subscriber!
I'm loving your ideas "
Loving your content!!
"I’m so happy to come across a name for this habit. A few months ago I realised it only really takes one habit to put your life on a good track. One afternoon I randomly started walking a few steps after a meal. I’m a sadly stationary person and I never walk. So I have myself small goals of 300 steps, then 550 steps and eventually made my way up to 5k a day. It took me a few days to finally touch 10k. 
But the beautiful part about this little exercise was, firstly it helped me see myself in a favourable light. From being a person who HATED walked to someone who thought it’s all fun and games to do 5k steps a day. And because I was designing my day around this habit, I also had to sleep and eat at better times, write more since I was suddenly so inspired. That month I ended up reading 5 books, averaging 3.3kms a day, joining the gym again to strengthen my body enough to help me increase the step count, and became way more positive in general.
So, THANK YOU for this video. It’s so motivating to see it’s a proven study and I can design my life based on life even if things seems hopeless and I don’t know where to start first."
It's how I've learnt so much from your videos I never even knew about.
"I loved the video, thanks for sharing. Really useful for me at this moment  <3"
This video was just what I needed. I’ve been trying to implement new routines and habits into my life but I’ve been having a lot of trouble with actually starting/sticking to them. I will definitely try adopting this method. I’ll let you know how it goes in three months time.
I've just discovered your channel by this video. I subscribed after listening for five minutes.
"Thank you, I really liked this video!"
I was thinking about this thing since few days and now it got cleared... Thank you for the confirmation and let me understand that i was right about my keystone habit which was helping me to stay productive but i wasn't feeling product anymore because i stopped doing my keystone habit.. Anyway as I'm aware now about my keystone habit so I'll start doing it from again ️
I also am one to feel better after live stream  in the morning.  otherwise if I don;t my day is plagued with all the things I should have said. As I watched your video You discussed may things that I was already familiar with.  I love how you took your introsept to understand what works for you. You definitely inspired me to keep up my routine. I hope you keep up yours.
Love the tempo and sound of your voice great content thank you so much
Thank you! I really needed this 
"I connected more with this video when you mentioned you're a morning person. It made me realise I am a morning person too, how I start morning really affect my productivity and mood throughout the day!~ its a new year, I hope to see new changes in myself in 6 months hehe. <3"
Happy New Year Tina!
Guys this works! I tried this keystone habit thing because I was like why not? Mine was making my bed as soon as I get up every morning. I forced myself to stick to it and after the first week I didn't notice anything crazy. It was actually nice to look at a made bed in the morning so I was like wth I'm going to continue this anyway. I started doing it impulsively without keeping the butterfly effect in mind. 2 weeks later I have realized that I have massively cut down on my social media addiction. Maybe it's just a coincidence idk. But key stone habits work!
"Let me tell you, my life was a mess and clueless before picking up some habits.

It's been a year since I started working out on a daily basis. For cardio, I dance. And I'm someone who loves to dance that sometimes I forget about the time. I began to notice that, though working out is a healthy habit, I'm spending more time than necessary and my time to do some other things is stolen by this habit.
Actually I had started tracking down my day, like making some simple notes on things that happened in a day and how I felt or reacted to everything that happened. It's been more than 2 months since I started doing it. And it's been almost a month since I improvised that habit into a more productive way as I realised that I should change my working out pattern. 

I started to make lists of things that I wanted to be done the next day, before going to bed and keep it beside me. Then I go through it after waking up, before starting my routines
I've heard people talking about dreams and goals that you should have, that are gonna be achieved in like 5 or 10 years. Yeah you should have those big dreams and goals. But actually the plans and goals for the very next day works better. 
I mean, when I started this diary writing or journalising habit, my long term goals began to have clarity. And my life is more organized and I'm getting things done!

Actually I didn't know about the butterfly effect or the studies and other things that's stated in this video. It just came to my feed when I looked for something else and when I watched it, I was like, oh! okay, this is what I'm doing and yeah it works!"
Such a perfect video for the new year! Cant wait to see you on the live stream!!!
"I'm establishing a consistent gym routine, but I'd say my keystone habit is meal prepping for the week ahead every Sunday.

Having prepped meals for the week is such a time saver. My goal is to expand Sunday as my comprehensive day of planning (task lists, journaling, editing, personal learning etc)"
"Yeah I didn't know what habit would be best for me, I'm already vegan, but it's definitely not the keystone. So I asked writing AI to recommend some habits for a dreamy, chill, creative person, and I found creative visualisation to be the nr 1, also journaling, but with my mind some things are to long to put on paper. And the last was meditation, which I love, but I usually spend like 30min completely out, so it's more suited for evenings. Really thanks for this video, it was very informative and interesting. Love your channel"
"After watching this video , i also want to establish the habit of waking up early , because it makes me feel the peace and organized. but it is hard for me to consist for a long period, hopefully , in 2023 i will be more consistant in what i want to do ."
"the motivation,life guidelines or in the field of life changing sectors woman youtubers are hardly comes with it, she doing very nice job by continuing that sector. I appreciate that fully from my heart."
I love how edge of picture on the backgroung split your haircut directly in half! It totally stole my attention :)
"hey!! i've been trying doing and following the morning routine that i made and somehow when i dont follow one of the things that i need to do in that routine i feel like so stressful and it affected my whole day, but i suddenly realise that, that thing might be the keystone for my daily activity, but i didnt know that it related to the butterfly effect, so after watching this now i know, thank u so much for the detailed explanation!!"
"My keystone habit is definitely bujoting :) the cue is needing make a to do list for the day, the routine is bujoting, the reward a pretty page and plan for the day, and then all over again the next day"
Best way to increase self-control: Exercise consistently and build physical muscle and self-control muscle
"Happy new year Tina , when i come to china I hope taking you drinking cup of coffee and taking pucture with you because you made me love data science and productivity"
"My keystone habit is drinking green tea. It makes me feel fresh and full of energy, but also dosent cause a crash or interfere with my already bad insomnia like coffee does. So i have so much energy that i want to do something productive with it. And it also improved my skin, heart, breathing and weight."
It was a recommendation video and thanks god i watch it. I really needed it i have a really big exam in less than one month and you know its summer i wanna change and I've  been struggling with changing and making a better routine for so long.this video actually taught me something and motivates me a lotjust wanna say thanks
Interesting. It has given me some things to think about. Thank you for posting.
Happy new year Tina 
"Watching this video made me think of around this time last year when I started to go on walks everyday. I had a lot of things I wanted to fix or change (my diet, my sleep schedule, my lack of motivation, and so on) but it was overwhelming so I eventually stopped caring about changing it all. Then I started to go on walks just for the peace and exercise.
However, I realized I really liked walking as soon as I woke up, which ended up helping to fix my sleep schedule as laying in bed for a few hours after waking up is something that was really hurting my sleep-wake cycle, and eventually I started getting up earlier to go on earlier walks. I also fell asleep faster and easier at night because I got up and moving as soon as I woke up.
I then stopped eating junk food at night because I realized it bothered my stomach on my walks. I also started to drink more water because that's what I would drink while on my walk and right after.
Since I loved walking, I decided to try jogging, and I got really bad runners stomach if I ate an unhealthy dinner, so I stopped eating junk food later in the day rather than just not at night. I also started drinking more water because I read that if you're dehydrated, it makes runners stomach worse.
Walking and jogging made me feel good about myself, and I started taking better care of myself, which also made me feel good about myself
I felt motivated to do little tasks I'd often procrastinate (especially right after I got back from a run, I always just wanted to do productive things once I got home)
It's insane how much that little task helped me take steps in so many other areas that needed improving"
"Damn girl, back to back to back videos. You r on fire!"
thank you for that video! just wanted to say that I absolutely love your hair!!
This is super helpful thank you! 
"I found this happened to me when I started meditating regularly. I started looking at what I was putting in my mouth, who I was social with and how I wanted to spend my time."
Two great books keep the suggestions coming!
Thank you for this first video I’ve seen on your channel. I’ve thought over the criteria (feel-good and rewarding for me and I WANT to do) and decided to try meditating for 5-10 mins every afternoon (precise time TBC). I’ve set a goal of doing it for two weeks and I’ll be back to tell you how it goes.
"i'm trying to learn english by watching your videos,you talk fast,it's a challenge for me , so i will keep watching your videos even if it takes me a long time. Love you"
Happy New Year Tina
"I love watching self improvemet videos, and you look really beautiful! so i just subscribe! :D"
"This is so interesting, definitely going to research and find what my keystone habit is "
I so needed to watch this right now!
THIS WAS SO HELPFUL  THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS !
"You look pretty in this video!

Reading before bed (and other times of day if I can) has become a keystone habit for me. I love learning and new experiences. Getting to sink into a different world in a relaxing time when no one is demanding anything from me has been super refreshing for me. It also goes great with a hot cup of chamomile."
Keep working at it start early keep moving. So they can look back a week or a year a couple years and see that what you've done can encourage you to keep forward. keep going
great video! you are so eloquent and love that you are a fast talker haha .
"Interesting video, thank you. FYI, you might want to let your sponsor know that on their main page that copy for module 2 is talking about module 3."
"my key stone habit is to start my day with an English lesson everyday in the morning at the same time. It is a nice video. I like your chanel, because you speak about personality development in a concrete way. Other people are to spiritual for me while they speak about subjects like this."
"amazing video so i compiled your video into a short summary easy enough to read and implement but hard enough so that they just have to watch the full video.

1. Find your goal.
2. Find your Keystone Habit.
3. Stay consistent.
4. Find good people.
well that 's it i suppose look into that 365datascience course or whatever.
loved your video sis."
"Thanks for the great videos TIna, you're doing great job!  I sympathize and hope your problem settled ASAP there. take care :)"
My key stone habit is definitely waking up at 5 a.m makes me more productive and energised than ever. I will try this for 6 months and see y’all then
I think that playing music every day (playing the violin) could be my new key core habit it makes me feel productive and makes me think clearer
A very good video! Thank you 
"I've found YouTube to be a very effective way of ""surrounding myself"" with people with similar goals :)"
I’m seeing this in my life right now. We became a single income family by choice but it naturally means having to change our habits. In an effort to save money I now walk much more which has meant large weight loss and my mind is looking for other ways constantly versus before it was easy to not pay attention with so much money coming in.
I really like your voice and than way u speak are so inspiring

Great video. I'm a Grandma and this will really help me. Thanks!
"I made a decision a couple of month ago to stop buying things online. I decided to first try to buy what I want in store before buying them online. That simple decision had such an impact on my life and it still does. I'm looking forward to see how much my life will still change.

Great video."
"Currenly I weirdly found that watching an ep of a kdrama first thing in the morning helps me. It gives me positive mood and view for the rest of the day. Somehow, starting the day with an uplifting kdrama works for me, even though you'd think it should be done only after getting smth done. Important part though is that this kdrama has the main character whom I admire and wanna be like. I also try to journal ontop of that though throughout the day..
And also, i strictly watch only 1ep per day, to not mess up my associations with the kdrama when i watch it. Plus I set my mind to study before i go to bed and watch this video before kdrama."
"Thanks it helped. I am not sure. But for me there are following: Meditation, Relax after hard day, journaling in night for self analysis, watching videos for what I want to do, mirror exercise - talking in mirror for 1 min. It takes around 3.5 hours in my day. There are some alternatives too like walking on beach or dancing, listening to good music."
Thank you Tina 
I love your youth and personality. Please keep it. It trull makes learning from you fun.  My keystone habit is yoga;/exercise/meditation
"I don't think the imagining habit should just be grouped in with the other habits because it's a whole different, albeit potentially equally beneficial, concept. The same brain areas get activated when you imagine yourself doing something as when you actually do it. So it's like training for your brain plus you'll be more confident in your abilities which also helps. But you don't need nearly as much discipline doing this than tracking your finances or exercising."
"Omg this is really cool. As a novelist, I started tracking my word count everyday for nanowrimo 2023 this year, and then one thing leads to another, I have lost weight, walked 10000 steps a day, and managed my finances much better. I like the Phelps keystone as well, every night I do think of my ideal self. :) thanks for your tip, love your content Tina."
Using a passion planner changed my life 5 years ago. It forced me to set goal and daily to do lists.
I bought the 365 and so far im happy with it
"I read the book ""Power of habits"" It's really dig down into the impact of habits on our life."
New subscriber. So glad I found your channel. I love you content and fun personality and videos (and hair:)
Inspiring! Thanks!
Go Tina!!!
this is great thank you! i totally changed my life around.  share how i do it come say hello!  may we all be lifted!
Fascinating!
Great video !!
I feel like the actual keystone for derek was isolating his problem and then analyzing how his financial habits were tied to his emotional states. Hence reflecting
6:22 play the movie in your head .... wonderful tip!
"Hi, could you please make a video about how to be programmer?!! Your entire journey, the things you learned and regret. It would be a great help for us."
My keystone habit is more like a morning routine- 1. Wake up at 6:45 am 2. Make to do list 3. brush my teeth 4. Exercise  and then start the day. This works for me. I am experimenting with my exercises. basically I stretch and do freehand exercises. It's easy to do and I am able to do it consistently.
"Thank you for this video, I think my keystone is on my night routine."
"This comment is to remind you to consistently focus on your goal Tina. :) I found your videos when I was trying to learn coding earlier this year. Guess what? I still haven't learn anything other than basic C++. Such a disappointment, isn't it? Your initial example in this vid is almost similar to my life except I'm more than 6 years younger, currently engaged & not addicted to drugs nor alcohol. I'm addicted to sugary drinks instead. When I feel like I can't do anything (even though I can think of so many things that need to be done), that's the moment I break the established habits & play games instead of focusing on what's more significant. If I were to continue in this route, I may end up in a similar scenario. I'll keep watching your videos while I continue to do my best for the next decade. For those who can see this comment, please get back to me every year for an update. I'll keep coming in your vids. Thanks Tina."
Very helpful . Thanks a lot
thank you so much!!!!!
happy new year 
Very smart!  Thanks
"Didn't the study later point to ?
- the kids who didn't have self-control were the same ones who grew up in a poor environment, in which current promises did not correlate with future availability of promised rewards? Why wait for 2 cookies at the cost of your current cookie, if you've previously learned that the current cookie will actually disappear?
- by contrast, the kids who grew up in better socio-economic environments did not possess that conditioning, because from their perspective: current self-control correlates with future rewards.

It's a trap, because that is not always the case, however finding the environments in which the above isn't the case is the actual challenge."
"Wow, you talk on 2x speed.  No wonder you are twice as productive.  You do inspire me Tina... as a data analyst."
Sometimes we can get a lot from a little bit of discipline and routine and schedule keep the schedule. Like if you don't pick up that first junk food or that first sweet that you won't have cravings of that junk food or that sweet later on. And you didn't know that you need to keep that in your mind when you see the temptation.
I love what you speak out about motvation.
"Thanks for the video...im not much social at all..im an introvert an empath...So i guess you talking about what works for you and extroverts....I funtion better alone..
90 porcent of people make so much noise . Cause me pain and stress...only generate distractions and most of themare very lost from theyre inner self ,aniway you make me realize that im  in  right path , thank you so much.."
Thank you for the awesome video. The butterfly effect when paired with HYPERFOCUSED INTENTIONALITY can unleash tremendous positive effects - not just personally but for the rest of the world. It even affects your DREAMS.
"Yeah, willpower!!"
"I have something similar to this in my head; I work in the restaurant business but I have 3 college degrees - I'm getting older, and I wonder if I'm too old.  SO, what do I see with older chefs and restauranteurs? It's the same thing over and over, losing their businesses to mental health problems.  Even ""great"" chefs actually have to give up their empire because of this, it happens CONSTANTLY.. but every time I see one more example of this, I see one more point added to my tally of career ending mental health problems mostly caused by long term alcohol use... Not surprisingly, I've lost my taste for beer"
"My keystone habit would be to wake up early and sleep early.I do everything else to make this possible. Also, live with some purpose. I cannot live aimlessly for days. I have to have a few targets for the day"
"Hi Tina, excellent video! A little suggestion on your wording when you were discussing how the study was replicated with different populations. I think perhaps a better, less stigmatizing phrasing of ""different levels of fuckedupness"" could be ""different levels of adversity"", maybe? Anyways, I would say that a keystone habit for me is 30 minutes of Loving-Kindness meditation. When I'm not in this practice, I find myself to be short-tempered, critical of other people, and frighteningly critical of myself heh."
"Omg keystone habit makes sense why whenever I stop doing yoga, all my other good habits take a dive toooooo wow"
Please do a YouTube short summarizing this concept.
I created a keystone habit and it’s workout out at least 1 hour a day even if it’s just walking. Seriously my life has gotten so much better.
Thanks!
Great video!
This is cool !  What gets the ball rolling? Thanks.  : )
"look imma get straight to the point here without any bs. if you want to develop go ahead and start the development. If you are in the loop of watching these types of videos then my friend you are just making yourself feel good and not doing anything. Stick to one idea. 
Also much respect to this content creator.

for those who understand"
Love this 
U r awesome  Love and respect from India 🇮🇳
I studied the butterfly effect during dynamical systems (chaos math) class in graduate mathematics. I always thought of it negatively.. like hurriances ..kill people but I like your video because this is the positive version.
"Awesome thank you appreciate it.
~~~"
"Loved the video,wanna change my profession"
My keystone habit will be practicing piano every morning. Thanks Tina
"when i do some kind of exercise in the morning, i am productive for the rest of the day and also make healthier choices. 
if i exercise in the afternoon or evening, it doesn’t have the same effect because i feel like most of the day is already gone so might as well do nothing  i’m afraid of exercising everyday due to injury but i’m thinking to maybe have so days where i just walk around the block instead of going hard at the gym."
"Wow, you are so productive recently"

"Drinking green and herbal tea can be a keystone habit for me.

It makes me drinks loads of water throughout the day. Keeps me from eating other things. I get a better sense for time and it grounds me and relaxes me. In general it makes me think more about my health"
My New Years goal was to make a total change and since we’re in March I’ll be back in July
Thank you very much 
"""the power of habit"" for more details and concept; however, if the book had to be boiled down to a short essay, this would be a video on representation of it."
Would definitely recommend atomic habits it's pretty much all this.
Woah! Should have watched a lot ago. Let's see if I will even implement it in my life lol
"Off-topic, but that color is so pretty on you! "

Tina my good habit is having a real alarm clock with my phone being placed 50 feet away from where l sleep
I think my keystone habit is the gym - I try to fo 3x a week and it has been working wonders for the past 2 weeks
The Michael Phelps thing sounds a lot like mind movies some ppl are talking about now where you watch a video with affirmations and visuals of what you want your dream life to look like before sleep and when waking up. I wonder if one of the reasons it works for people is this whole keystone habit thing.
"I'm a programmer. I did a 4 month bootcamp and now I'm searching for a job but it's been 2.5 months and I had just one interview. All my habits went to the trash. I'm not learning anything new because I'm highly unmotivated and depressed, I'm not eating healthy and I have lots of negative thoughts.  I started swimming classes this week and I feel better though. I'll come back in 6 months to report my situation."
"1:37 ""No money""  Ok i like that one."
making my bed is a HUGE keystone habit for me!! when i don't do it i feel like i just walked out of my apartment naked haha
"to me that’s dancing, it gives me instant happiness, I’ll integrate in my routine more often "
you know what... i'm going to figure out which key habit to have and try it bc why not lol
Changes is your Attitude
"this coorelates to medicine students i watch here on yt, they study work film and train hard and then have time for social acitivities and i always wonder whats up with them, turns out they may have built that key habit early on and now everything productive falls into place"
Thanks a lot
I think what triggered my butterfly effect was buying a fish. Keystone habit was the routine taking care of the fish. My entire life has been changing slowly since
Practice makes PERMANENT!
I like the idea
My keystone habit will be visualization!
Love you 
Awesome!
"That's very interesting 
I wonder what my key stone habit is
Is there any way to find it?"
"Good video. I do believe that you dont need many people to be happy/successful, especially social media, stay away from it."
"What matches me: visualizing, waking up early, working early, community, moving/sports 
So I need to figure out my keystone now ️"
"Thanks for an interesting topic I really enjoyed it ,just want to say that not everyone needs an accountability buddy. Have you read The four Tendencies by Gretchen Rubin. Its a whole new way of looking at why some people need different types of motivation to get things done"
For me is going to bed no later than 10pm. Everything starts at the night before morning.
"~LOL! I typed this 4min into the video and now you're saying just what I was typing. Thats funny. Thanks for the affirmation! ~

This is the reason so many seemingly small tasks like, making your bed every day, taking cold showers/cold plunging, getting in your 10k steps, etc. etc. etc. are all billed as ways to self-improvement. Thing is, it's not the task itself that creates the habit or discipline, it's the active decision to dedicate yourself to doing whatever the task is you choose. Ergo the famous slogan from Nike: ""Just Do It"" 
It's the act of committing to the doing that is the real unlock here. Great video."
"Hello Tina, happy new year ! I'm not native english speaker but i love watch yours videos wich are very interesting to improve my english. I wonder if you have heard of chatGPT and if it impacts your business ? In a good or bad way or maybe both ?"
Keystone habit for me is knitting  and also gratitude

"I think want to try with wake up at 4 am,  and sleep for 7 hours, ill check again in a week or a month :)"
"I liked this video, but I'm not sure I agree.  I was always a very lazy individual.  And so  I started a rigid exercise routine when I was 31 years old, because I never exercised before in my life (6' tall, a very skinny 120lbs at the time), never had much self-control about anything, and kept that routine, never missing a single week of exercise, until I was 66 years old and retired.  I have no more self-control now than the day I started,  Every day I start my exercise routine, I have to force myself--willfully push myself as every cell does not want to do it.  It never once became a habit.  And, more relevant, it never spilled over to anything else in my life.  Even after all those years of consistency, I can drop it like a dead racoon and never do it again.  Easy.  My nature is to be lazy and do nothing and that tendency has never changed in my life no matter what I do.  I hate exercise and that has never changed, and yet my workout is about 3 continuous hours every other day.  No instinctual habit ever formed and there never was any collateral progress. 

So while you make a compelling case, my personal experience tells me otherwise."
Wanna know something cool? A friend started me on a keystone habit last week and did not call it that. That is a very good friend.
first view  .. happy new year Tina

"also, what Michael Phelps was doing, was hypnosis and visualization most of the top athletes, and also executive performers use Hypnosis where if they spend enough time getting in the mental zone and priming their mind for it it's more effective than physical practice, which has a bunch of studies behind it and a book by Maxwell, Maltz called psycho cybernetics who was a cosmetic surgeon that noticed some people dramatically changed after having corrective surgery, and some people kept the same self-concept and identity in their consciousness after the surgery in there, for their lives did not improve, and that consciousness is really more important than the external.

I think going to class is a keystone habit. I notice i tend to slack off and do much less when i have nowhere to go. I study right there at school and then go to the gym after because I'm already outside the house
What if you don’t want to? Thanks for the video it is good well made.

"The whole problem you describing comes from procrastination, boredom and all similar things. So while yoga, gym, watering plants and other routines can help I think the best thing is to find a really big passion, driving force that gonna make you jumping out of bed in the morning eager do to good.

"Here is how I found out my keystone. You start questioning yourself of activities that lead to one and another until you end up against the wall. The last activity might be your keystone activity. To me I found out that consistently going to supermarket to buy food is the keystone. This will lead to healthy diet then lead to energy for exercises then lead more productivity and focus. Try to find yours! It works, guys!"
It is proven that self control/willpower are NOT going to change a habit long term because it is a limited resource. It works short term but anything that requires a perceived sacrifice will eventually fail. You can only succeed if you do something that does not involve a sacrifice.
For me keystone is going for walks and breathing fresh air. Without getting out for walks I turn into a goblin.

What is the keystone.
"""level of fucked-upness"" - it sounds like a metric we need to solidify the findings of the study, but I wonder how they measure that :)"
"you can also train your subconscious mind for different preferences and completely reset your baseline making real power and self control anon factor on certain things like financial discipline and weight regulation, as well as healthy habits and even your personal confidence your self-concept your identity a lot of times changing all that makes everything else fall into place a lot easier and doesn't take a lot of effort if you have the right hypnotherapist and you do regression while under hypnosis to find out the root cause for one of these things which will usually tell you how your brain has molded your identity from childhood, and once you figure out that connection you can interrupted and install new software. Yes, self-discipline and will power or something that you can expand on but ultimately they are if a night supply they've also found this out and research that most of the time, especially with people trying to control their waking will typically eat the things  that are unhealthy for them closer to the end of the evening after they powered through a day and stress will wear down your willpower"

"Kind of a superficial approach.   

Under Platonic model-- self discipline (self control) is one of the core constructs of an advanced person.   Working  against  discipline are the loves and fears.   When discipline is excessive, it  becomes alike imprisoning the self.   When it's lax, time and  various body parts are also not working in harmony.

So, though self-discipline is a critical part, there are other parts that fight against self-discipline, and all these need to be understood to make harmonious changes."
